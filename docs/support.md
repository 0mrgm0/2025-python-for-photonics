#Support the Workshop and Future STEM Outreach

<img align="right" width="200" src=../pictures/Sponsors.png alt="image" />
Your contribution—whether a corporate sponsorship, foundation grant, or personal donation—helps us run a high-impact event and seed future programs that prepare students and early-career researchers for success in photonics and wider STEM fields.

Partnering with the 2025 IEEE Summer School and Workshop on Photonics Automation puts your brand in front of the next generation of optics innovators. Depending on the support level, sponsors may receive:

- Brand visibility – logo on the workshop website, program booklet, and podium slides throughout the workshop.

- Spotlight talk – a 5-minute vendor/industry flash talk or live demo during the Industry Showcase.

- Exhibit table – space for hardware displays, brochures, and one-on-one conversations with attendees.

- Acknowledgement on the workshop website (the site will stay online as a repository of slides, code, and other materials for future events)

Have another idea—equipment loans, swag, snacks, or student award? We’re flexible and happy to tailor a package that aligns with your mission.
