# Welcome to 2025 IEEE Summer School and Workshop on Photonics Automation  

Overview: This four‑day workshop is designed for students and early‑career researchers who want to automate photonics experiments. Participants will learn to control optical components, design end‑to‑end measurement architectures, and convert raw data into clear visualisations. The programm follows the entire automation pipeline—from hardware drivers to data analysis—combining theory with hands‑on implementation. While the lectures and demonstrations cover various automation tools, the hands-on sessions will focus primarily on Python.

Beyond skills training, the school functions as an *interactive forum* where students and researchers can present emerging results, debate new methods, and exchange pre‑publication ideas. Keynote talks, industry showcases, live lab demonstrations, and structured coding sessions round out an intensive, collaborative learning experience.

## Program structure:

Day 1 → Presentations (peer‑reviewed talks)

Days 2–4 → Hands-on sessions

## Why Enroll?
Python is rapidly becoming the control language of modern optics labs. In this four‑day intensive school you will learn to:

- **Drive photonic hardware** – integrate lasers, shutters, motorized stages, spectrometers, and cameras through easy‑to‑read Python scripts.

- **Automate measurements** – create end‑to‑end workflows that align optics, trigger acquisitions, capture metadata, and stream results in real time.

- **Process & visualize data** – turn raw traces and images into publication‑ready insights using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

- **Adopt best practices** – version‑control experiments, document procedures, and build reusable code modules that scale with your research.

**Target Participants:** The symposium welcomes students, early-career researchers, and established scientists, as well as others with a professional interest in experiment automation. Attendees may choose to participate as observers, contribute an oral presentation or poster, or engage in both activities. The hands-on sessions are tailored for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as early-career researchers with a basic knowledge of Python who are looking to apply programming skills to photonics research and experiment automation.
