#Prerequisites — only for Day 2-4 Hands-On Participants

*Day 1 symposium attendees do not need to meet these technical requirements.*

- Laptop with admin rights and a working install of Python 3.12 (or any current 3.x release).
A detailed setup guide will be posted here in advance.

- Participants are encouraged to attend a test-run meeting on Monday (time TBA) to ensure the smooth operation of the code during the hands-on sessions. Several back-up computers will be available throughout the workshop in case of troubles with personal laptops.

- Participants are expected to have a basic knowledge of Python: 

| Topic                        | You should be able to…                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Running Python**           | • launch the interpreter or Jupyter Notebook<br>• install a package with `pip` or `conda`                       |
| **Variables & data types**   | • create and print `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool` values<br>• understand simple arithmetic and string formatting |
| **Collections**              | • build and index a `list`, `tuple`, and `dict`<br>• iterate over a list with `for item in list:`               |
| **Control flow**             | • write `if / elif / else` branches<br>• use `for` and `while` loops, including `break` / `continue`            |
| **Functions**                | • define a function with `def my_func(arg):`<br>• return a value and call the function from another cell        |
| **Modules**                  | • import a standard library module (`import math`, `import time`)                                               |
| **Basic I/O**                | • read / write a text file with `open()`<br>                                                                    |
| **Very light OOP awareness** | • know that a *class* bundles data and methods—even if you’ve never written one (we’ll start there on Day 2)    |
