Bring a laptop with Pythonâ€¯12+ and admin rights.

A guideline for the required environment installation will be posted here. 

Participants are encouraged to attend a test-run meeting on Monday to ensure the smooth operation of the code during the hands-on sessions. Several back-up computers will be available throughout the workshop in case of troubles with personal laptops.

Participants are expected to have a basic knowledge of Python. We recommend to go over one of these online courses to refresh your knowledge:

Note: The workshop will use classes substantially.
