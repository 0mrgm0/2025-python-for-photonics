Viktoriia Rutckaia and Diana Strickland

9:30am – 12:30pm Morning session 1:  Controlling optical elements with Python
INSTRUCTOR: DR. MARIO MARQUES

This session we will introduce a method of controlling individual optical components with Python scripts. It will include an interactive laboratory element with hands-on coding to control optical elements.

12:30pm – 2:00pm Lunch, tours

2:00pm – 5:00pm Afternoon session 1: Graphical user interface and coding architecture
INSTRUCTOR: DR. ROMAIN TIROLE


#Wednesday, 9 July 2025

9:00am – 12:30pm Morning session 2:  Python Control for ultrafast lasers, Data Visualization with Python
INSTRUCTOR: KAMYAR RASHIDI

In this session I will discuss how to control hardware for ultrafast spectroscopy using Python. We will learn how to interface and control various components in an optical setup, such as the laser, delay stage, optical rotation components, as well as the sampling and detection systems. Additionally, we will review methods for data collection and analysis, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to manage both the hardware and the data throughout the spectroscopy process.

12:30pm – 2:00pm Lunch, project presentations
