Evripidis Michail’s research focuses on light–matter interactions, with the goal of investigating functional optical and electronic properties of materials and nanodevices to enable their integration into advanced technological applications.   
His work primarily centers on the design and development of high-throughput, ultrafast optical and optoelectronic probes. These tools enable sensitive spectroscopic characterization of materials and photonic devices under conditions of strong light–matter coupling or intense electromagnetic fields. Through these techniques, he explores distinctive materials' properties, thereby proposing the design of nanodevices or molecular architectures with tailored functionalities, contributing to a robust scientific foundation with relevance to emerging technologies.  
Evripidis joined the Advanced Science Research Center in 2021 as a Research Associate in Professor Matthew Sfeir’s research group within the Photonics Initiative. He earned his Ph.D. in Applied and Chemical Physics from Julius Maximilians University of Würzburg in Germany and received his master’s and bachelor’s degrees in physics from the University of Patras in Greece.

I’m an optics and photonics researcher specializing in the optimal design and experimental study of optical and photonic devices. I have hands-on experience testing optical modules, performing various optical measurements (such as spectroscopy and Fourier imaging), and automating these processes using object-oriented programming.
